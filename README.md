#Timewhale
A mobile time management agenda designed for students with intensive workloads. User experience is a major focus, with intuitive interface design, user feedback, and touch gesture support. Your most important tasks are displayed on the homepage, so that you know your priorities at a glance. Make the most of your time while managing your time!

Created using jQueryMobile, and heavily CSS-custom-styled to emulate Android UI.
